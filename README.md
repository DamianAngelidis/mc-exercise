# mc-exercise

## Bob and Carol didn't do a pull request and didn't let the team know that they began working on something else

## No one changed out of the master branch once other people started working with each other

## Groups started commiting things without communication with the whole group

## Partners A-C-P without communicating wih group about what they did

### What they should have done

1. Made sure that they were all communicating with each other about what they were doing with the code

2. Make sure that everytime partners work on new branches each time and not on master

3. Make sure to do pull origin master before you start working on new code
